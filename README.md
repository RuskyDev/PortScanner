# PortScanner
PortScanner allows you to quickly scan ports on any IP address.

## Features
- Lightweight and super fast
- Saves open ports to `open-ports.txt` after scanning
- Displays whether ports are UDP or TCP

## Usage:
```sh
R:\Data\Programming\Projects\PortScanner\>py src/main.py
Usage: main.py --target-ip=<IP> --start-port=<start> --end-port=<end>
```
